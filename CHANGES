Revision history for Perl module Data::Structure::Util

0.12 Wed Jun 21 15:37:40 2006

  - Check return value of av_fetch in the debug code
  - Need to check the return value of av_fetch() in circular_off
  - Avoid the "unknown error" (which was actually the hash or array we were
    traversing suddenly being deleted from underneath us) by holding an additional
    reference to the passed in structure.
  - Make the "Unknown error" message a lot more helpful
  - _circular_ref should check the return value of av_fetch
  - Substitute a sane way of chosing the test plan
  - Convert t/02circular to Test::More
  - _signature should check the return value of av_fetch
  - _get_refs should check the return value of av_fetch
  - Convert t/05refs.t to Test::More
  - Check the return value from av_fetch in _utf8_flag and _utf8_flag_set
  - _has_utf8 should check the return value of av_fetch 
  - convert 04utf8.t to Test::More
  - Check return value from av_fetch in _unbless
  - Check the return value from av_fetch is not NULL before deferencing it in
    _get_blessed
  - Use Test::More rather than Test::Simple in t/03bless.t
  - Use Test::More's eq/ne functiosn rather than comparisons inside the
    arguments to ok()
  - Have to use a hash ref rather than a hash and keep taking references for
    the signature test, as temporary refs are in the signature, and their
    address can
  - differ each time round the loop
  - Remove C99-isms from the debugging code
  - Use the SvFLAGS() macro rather than a direct structure access
